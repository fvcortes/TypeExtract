In this section, we will give some examples of generated reports obtained by passing a full program as input to the type extractor. The program analysis is not supposed to be fast. The overhead of a Lua call for each hook is high enough to leverage time performance, but memory measurements are useful to understand the extractor behaviour for each benchmark.
